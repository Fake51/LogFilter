Introduction
============
This is just a simple Apache access file parser, to parse
out some basic statistics from Apache log files. It was
created as a learning project to get more experience with
Python.

The parser will allow for extracting basic information like
frequency of requests from IP addresses, requests by transfer
size, etc. It also allows for some rudimentary filtering
by IP and response status.

Requirements
============
Python 2.7+

Installation
============
Just make sure the logfilter.py is executable.

Usage
=====
Use the help option of the parser for more here.
